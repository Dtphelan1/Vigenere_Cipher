Vigenere Cipher
===============

### Summary
A repository for a Vigenere Cipher client I made, that encrypts 
and decrypts given blocks of text using a Vigenere Cipher.

### Files
There are two major files right now: 

    1. A .cpp file that serves as the source code for the project.
    
    2. An executable file that runs the program.
   
### Regarding compiling: 
     
    The source code was compiled using the standard g++ compiler 
    for C++. If someone wanted to recompile the code locally,
    all they would need to type is: 
     
    g++ -Wall -Wextra Vigenere_Cipher_Client.cpp -o Vigenere_Cipher_Client
